# Jaipur_cardgame-
This is an c++ implentation of Jaipur CardGame which is a two-player card game about trading things on the market. <br/>
This game compiles in UNIX environment in which the GUI is simply rendered by ASCII characters. <br/>
Players could type in commands to move, the status will be updated after each move. <br/>
Though the program only support two players mode(no AI), it was thorough tested under that mode. <br/>

## Installation
Simplay clone this repository and type in
``` 
$ make
$ ./jaipur
``` 
in the console. 
The compiler version is c++11.

## Usage 
A detail rule and guide of the game could be view [here](images_and_GameGuide/Jaipur-rules.pdf).<br/>
Follow the prompt information and type things as informed, it's fairly easy. <br/>
Don't worry if any typo happened, the prompt will always be there until a valid input is given.<br/>
There is also an online version with delicate game graphics [here](https://en.boardgamearena.com/#!gamepanel?game=jaipur)

## Appreciation
This is a team work of of Xin Bai and QingJie Li. 
Special thanks to my partner Qingjie who contributed a lot to this project especially the whole control on the program structure and the ASCII UI which is quite impressive.
